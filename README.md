# AHK
Compilation of AutoHotKey Scripts

autocomplete.ahk - listen for a word and change it to something else such as an email signature.

codesnippy.ahk - command-based tool for making HTML5 development easier. Eliminates extra typing for HTML tags and allows easy filename selection. (A work in progress.)

chromestop.ahk - hit CTRL + Z to force quit Google Chrome. Useful when stumbling upon malicious webpages or endlessly opening popup windows.
